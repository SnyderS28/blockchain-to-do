# blockchain-to-do
To Do list built with Ethereum smart contracts

You'll need to install Truffle 5.0.2 for this to work. Truffle is a local blockchain environment.
This app uses Truffle to interaction with the local blockchain to create tasks (smart contracts) and pay "gas" fees.

You will also need Metamask (a Chrome extension) installed. The client side of this project needs to interact with
a crypto wallet which Metamask provides. Then import the private key of the first Truffle account--the one used
for the smart contract deployment.
